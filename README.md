  <h4>Random jokes from <strong>jokeapi.dev</strong></h4>
  <h3>Java and C were telling jokes. It was C's turn, so he writes something on the wall, points to it and says "Do you get the reference?" But Java didn't.</h3>

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How does it works?

Using the power of [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), we could create a scheduled job to commit a change to Github.

Using [Node](https://nodejs.org), we can change the README file (you're reading it now) to something interesting everytime. This could be easily modified on `writer.js`.

<sub>Oh, I also have to credit [`erickchann`](https://github.com/erickchann) for the idea.</sub>

## üîß Can we modify this to our liking?

Absolutely! Just go to the `writer.js` code conveniently sitting at the root directory, you could change the README file template or add other cool things.

You could also change how frequent the job occurs. Just modify the **`runner.yml`** file at `.github/workflows`, `schedule` section. Feel free to change the cronjob to something reasonable.

**Don't forget to change the Git email and username!!**
